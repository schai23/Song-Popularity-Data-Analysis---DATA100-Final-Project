# DATA100 Final Project

Raiyan Junaid, Justin Lee, Dylan Plut, Seamus Chai

This project will analyze the relationships between various components of songs, specifically their length, popularity, and complexity. Our objective is to find the optimal values for each of our properties to make a song have the highest chance of succeeding.

The code file is called "Final Project.Rmd". The submitted file is called "Final-Project.pdf".

One of our csv files were too large to post on GitHub and LFS did not want to work so the link to get the "track_artists.csv" file is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs

The repo for the Python scripts that were used to pull data can be found here:
